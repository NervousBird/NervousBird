## Leo Walton 👋

 I'm a NZ developer with ties to The Netherlands. Before getting into coding I was working a simple job at DHL, while learning Dutch, getting married, and doing general life things. Before even that, I was a freelance artist, doing illustration for private clients, and briefly working on a student magazine. I love making things, anything creative, and am extremely interested in ethical technologies, and making technology that actually helps society. (So not generative AI, pick up a pencil)

 After college, I studied classical music, 3D animation and film, and have taught myself so many programs, and done so much. Eventually I found coding, and it has allowed me to basically take everything I love, and do it all in one.

Check out my art, webdesigns, and other things on my website here:

## Current Projects

### Personal Portfolio

Creating a website to host my art, websites, and anything I want. This is a passion project, and something I want to just build and design for my own benefit, therefor - it's a bit wacky.
